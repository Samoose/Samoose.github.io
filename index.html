                    <div class="about-us-content col-sm-8">
                        <p>Founded in June 2015 in Downtown Santa Monica, Coblic was established by seven students as a social media management firm. Since then, we have worked to establish ourselves as a leader in the use of social media to promote businesses both locally and nationally.</p>
                        
<p>Technology is ever expanding across multiple panels of media and devices. Coblic will use that to our advantage as we enter into the social media and marketing industry. By identifying and incorporating micro-trends in today’s society, we will tailor our client’s social media pages to better attract their target audience. Our industry targets a wide range of markets - from small local businesses to large corporate companies. Since our company’s personnel are based in and around Santa Monica, it gives us key advantages in this personalized approach. Businesses yearn for personalized marketing that will draw in larger and more diverse groups of customers, exactly what we offer.  With teens and young adults consistently adopting newer forms of mobile media, and the older generations doing the same, advertising needs to adapt. It needs a company that sees and understands the complexity of social interactions over the web. It needs to transgress traditional ideas and use modern mediums to reach new customers. Be it Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest, Coblic offers businesses the ability to reach out to those customers.</p>

<p>Traditional PR firms generally cater towards traditional medias, radio, TV, and print. Those few that offer social media advertising, offer literal ads on sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. As a result, our services stand out as being unique. Too few companies use today’s popular media to its full extent, and rather come across to the millennial crowd as ignorant or uninteresting. Coblic is set on fixing this. As we are all young adults ourselves, we understand our age group better than any company could. That understanding directly translates to personal connections between clients and consumers, and that is what we offer. Connections between large businesses and their clientele that feel as personal as friends talking on Facebook.</p>

                                <p>Facebook has more than one billion users, and that gives businesses endless opportunities for growth within their customer base. Users share and invite their friends to like pages, and through word-of-mouth promotion, businesses can vastly expand their consumer demographic. Young adults spend a lot of time browsing facebook, and pay a lot of attention to the activites of freinds. Seeing a friend like a company's page is a massive influence on if they would be willing to do the same. </p>
