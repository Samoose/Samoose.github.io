                    <p>Many businesses are at a loss as to how to connect with millennials: the primary market of all future consumers. Coblic is a social media agency that helps businesses connect with their customers. As technology and social media is expanding faster than ever, Coblic will take advantage of the growth by tailoring our clients’ social media pages to broaden their consumer market and attract those millennials.</p>
                    <p>Coblic was founded as a social media agency in June 2015 in Downtown Santa Monica by seven students. Since then, we have worked to establish ourselves as a leader in the use of social media to promote businesses both locally and nationally. By identifying and incorporating micro-trends in today’s society, we are able to focus on what makes a businesses’ services and products appealing to both new and returning customers.</p>
                    <p>Social media agencies today do not use social media to its full extent, and come across to the millennial crowd as rather ignorant or uninteresting; Coblic is set on fixing this. As we are young adults, Coblic understands how to directly translate a business’s products and services into a personal connection between the business and its consumers. We do this not only through Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, but through website and campaign management as well.</p>
                    <p>Websites are often overlooked as a way to advertise, since if they are on your site, your work is done! Wrong, you still have to make a sale. All too often, consumers visit a website with the intent to buy their product, but due to the poor design, they end up navigating away. We offer to update your website, make it clean, and optimized for higheer results in google searches.</p>

                                <p>Facebook has more than one billion users, and that gives businesses endless opportunities for growth within their customer base. Users share and invite their friends to like pages, and through word-of-mouth promotion, businesses can vastly expand their consumer demographic. Young adults spend a lot of time browsing facebook, and seeing a friend like a company's page if a massive influence on if they would be willing to do the same. </p>
